Compiling
=========

Install poppler's development files:
sudo apt-get install libpoppler-qt5-dev

Install Qt5 private development files:
sudo apt-get install qtdeclarative5-private-dev qtbase5-private-dev

If you want to compile an arm click package, you need to install that package to the arm compilation environment. For example when using QtCreator for Ubuntu Touch, open Options -> Ubuntu -> Maintain, and then enter:

apt-get install libpoppler-qt5-dev:armhf qtdeclarative5-private-dev:armhf qtbase5-private-dev:armhf
